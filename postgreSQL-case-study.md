## Brief History

Provide a brief history of the product, including major milestones or events.

You may use bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs or a timeline.

This ORDBMS which stands for Object Relational Database Management system is PostgreSQl which is taken from the POSTGRES package written at the University Berkley. POSTGRES was used for mant different research and production application which include a financial data analysis system, a jet enginge performance monitoring package, and asteroid tracking database, a medical information database, and several geographic information systems. It has also been used as an educational tool at several universities. 

# The Berkley POSTGRES Project

1986 - The implementation of POSTGRES began and the project, led by Professor Michael Stonebraker, was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Agency, the Army Research Office, the National Science Foundation and ESL, Inc.

1987 - The first "demoware" system became operational.

1988 - The system was shown at the ACM-SIGMOD Conference.

1989 - Version 1 was released to a few external users.

1990 - Following a critique of the first rule system, the rule system was redesigned and Version 2 was released with the new rule system.

1991 - Version 3 appeared where it was added support for multiple storage managers, and improved query executor, and a rewritten rule system. 

1992 - POSTGRES became the primary data manager for the Sequoia 2000 scientific computing project.

1993 - The size of the external user community almost doubled. The Berkley POSTGRES Project officially ended with Version 4.2 because maintenance of the prototype code took up large amounts of time that should have been devoted to database research.

# Postgres95

1994 - An SQL language interpreter was added by Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen, and Postgres95 which was its new name, was released to the web as an open source descendant of the original POSTGRES. 
Performance and maintenance were improved, it ran faster, bugs were fixed and got many enhancements.

# PostgreSQL

1996 - New name was implemented to PostgreSQL to reflect the relationship between the original POSTGRES and the more recent versions with SQL capability.
